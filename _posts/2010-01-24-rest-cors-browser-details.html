Today my Saturday project was to create a page that systematically tests the RESTful and CORS (XHR2) capabilities of browsers.
<br>

<br>
I've used <b>sync</b>hronous (not async) calls to keep browsers from hammering my small server, so you'll have to wait for all 50 or so calls to complete, which takes a minute or two.
<br>

<br>
RESTTest:

<br>

<br>
CORSTest:
<br>
http://resttest.whatsayye.com/
<br>

<br>
Later I'll clean it up and turn it into a table and, perhaps, store the results of visitors to create a version that only runs the tests if they haven't already been run on your browser.
<br>
