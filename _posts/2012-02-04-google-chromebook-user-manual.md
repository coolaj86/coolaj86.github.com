This product contains sensitive components. Do not drop, disassemble, open, crush,
bend, bake, deform, puncture, blend (guess we'll never know if it'll blend), shred,
incinerate, paint, bring to the moon, or insert foreign objects into the device. Do not
spill liquids, rocks of any size, or food on the device. Do not expose the device to
water, moisture, or rap music.

This product contains small parts, which may present a choking hazard to small
children, as well as men who have not emotionally matured. Keep the device and
accessories away from small children, regardless of how much they want to bang on
the keyboard.

When you perform repetitive activities such as typing or playing games on the device,
you may experience occasional discomfort in your hands, arms, shoulders, neck, or
other parts of your body. Take frequent breaks and if you have discomfor during or
after use, stop use and see a physician. We'd make jokes here, but we really want you
to look after yourselves.

This product does not contain any user-serviceable parts. Repairs should only be
made by an authorized technician. Note that authorized technicians do not necessarily
include your neighborhood 15 year old brainiac that you call anytime you get an
antivirus pop-upon your computer (note: you shouldn't see antivirus pop-ups on this
device anyway). As cool as laptop ground effects are, unauthorized repairs or
modifications could result in pemanent damage to the equipment, and void your
warranty and your authority to operate this device under applicable regulations.

**Battery**: This device includes a lithium-ion batter, as that whole cold fusion thing
hasn't been figured out yet. There is a risk of explosion, fire and burns if the battery is
handled improperly. Don't do anything silly with the battery. Don't puncture,
incinerate, short the contacts, try to disassemble the battery, or expose the battery to
water or high temperatures (>60 degrees C/140 degrees F). We already said not to
bake the device, but apparently we needed to repeat ourselves. Replace only with the
specified replacement battery. Recycle or dispose of used batteries according to local
regulations.

Install the battery

Attach the power cable

Install the battery as indicated in the figure (I drew it myself - I think I'm going into art
after being a copy editor). Then connect the power cable as indicated. The battery is
not fully charged, but, like most things in life, with some work you can change that. So
please please connect the power cable and fully charge the battery before using the
device for the first time. The power indicator will be organge until the battery is fully
charged. It's tricky like that.

**Display**: When opening or closing the display panel, place one hand on the palm rest
to hold the device in place and use the other hand to slowly open or close the display
panel. You can try opening the display panel with one hand, but that geos into
extreme display opening and may be frowned upon by someone special in your life.
You can turn on the power by pressing the button indicated in the figure, or just by
opening the display panel. That's right - we removed one step between you and the
Internet. Shock. And. Awe. Do not use excessive force wwhen opening or closing the
display panel, or we may ask you to take an anger management class. Be careful not
to open the display panel too far as this could put stress (physical and emotional) on
the display panel's hinges and cause damage.
