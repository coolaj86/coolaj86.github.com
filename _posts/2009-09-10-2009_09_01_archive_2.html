Information Technology is for kids who never outgrew video games and want an excuse to have the best gaming system known to mankind in their homes, and also enough money to buy it.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm more in the first category; I don't even play video games.</div><div><br /></div><div>If there were a major in between those two that had an emphasis on design and interaction, that's what I would major in.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5446962-2648258071971620601?l=coolaj86.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
