The Short
====

It's terrible. Just look at the product reviews on Amazon.

Instead consider the [Fujitsu SnapScan 1500](http://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-Instant-Sheet-Fed-Macintosh/product-reviews/B001XWCQO2/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1)


The Long
====

A few weeks ago I bought a 'NeatDesk for Mac' multi-document, double-sided, auto-feed scanner.
I bought it so that I could clean up the mess of cluttered papers I've collected over the years.

I got it for just $300 on eBay. I only bid because I didn't think that I would win - but I thought
that $300 would be a great deal if I won... and I did. Surprise!

All of the scanners I've seen have a price point of about $400, so I thought that the promise of the
NeatDesk - as seen on TV (TM) - might be worth it.

Cons
====

I was mostly unimpressed. This is my first experience with an auto-feed document scanner.
This may be one of the very best, for all I know.

Software
----

  * Not intuitive. The software is Cocoa... but it's not Mac-Simple.
  * Freezes.... all the time. I've tried to
  * auto-crop crops too close
  * Not much documentation
  * Runs scan and OCR in the same process... and CRASHES!
  * FLOODS contacts with empty contacts or useless contacts (single words as a name - no email, no phone number)
  * Can't do multi-document OCR after initial scan

Hardware
----

  * Feeds in almost all documents croocked
  * Only accepts 25 pages at a time
  * Locks-up, light blinks, and has to be power cycled - usually on 20+ page scans

Pros
====

Even with the cons, I still would have bought it - or at least something like it.

  * Auto-feed. Click the button, it scans.
  * Sometimes Detects and removes blank pages


Preferred Solution
====

  * OCR with DB and API
  * More reliable hardware / software combo - just the driver
  * Up to 75 pages at once
