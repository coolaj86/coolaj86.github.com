The Omega Patent.
<br>

<br>
I was so inspired by Blackboard's patent on transmitting educational information between computers that today I submitted my own patent on a system called 'Intelligence'.
<br>

<br>
For the layman the description of my patent is essential this:
<br>
"The process by which a thing is made better or worse or different."
<br>

<br>
And for those of you that are better with pictures, here's an example.
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Hobzfd-C10I/SsKmofZgqII/AAAAAAAAAw4/epabUxYUdTk/s1600-h/intelligence.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Hobzfd-C10I/SsKmofZgqII/AAAAAAAAAw4/epabUxYUdTk/s320/intelligence.png" /></a>
<br>
</div>Notice how the graphical example I provided is different from the sentence above, but demonstrates the same information - yet another demonstration of my patented system.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5446962-8451969102412132018?l=coolaj86.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
