I'm in search of a web API framework.
<br>

<br>
I'm not interested in building web clients on the server. Why should the client logic reside on the server? That makes no sense.
<br>

<br>
FRAPI II
<br>

<br>

<br>
FRAPI is many steps in the right direction, but too limited.
<br>

<br>
I want something like PURE for the API where I can define a directive which maps to a data structure.
<br>

<br>
One benefit to this is I can provide the developer with a structure quite a bit flatter than the database model (and for that matter, perhaps SQL isn't the premier option for web mashups).
<br>

<br>
Another benefit is I can define what's public very easily.
<br>

<br>
The solution would be implemented on both the I and the O of I/O. Perhaps some values are not publicly visible, but they are publicly writable (and more commonly the reverse). A directive also provides validation. The hash could map a value's name to the function which validates it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5446962-7624267440799506308?l=coolaj86.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
