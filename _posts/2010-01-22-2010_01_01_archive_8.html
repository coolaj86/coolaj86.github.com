Attention Apple: Steal this Idea<div>(I don't have the time to write my own right now)</div><div>
<br>
</div><div>
<br>
</div><div>The biggest hugest most absurdly annoying flaw with the iPod / iPhone / iTouch is that there's no way to edit playlists while you're listening to the music -- that being the time that you're listening to it.</div><div>
<br>
</div><div>You don't always know what song you want until you're listening to music and you want it.</div><div>
<br>
</div><div>
<br>
</div><div>Solution:</div><div>Keep the entire iTunes household music catalog on the iPod. Allow me to choose "Add this Song at next Sync" or "Remove this Song at next Sync (or right now)"</div><div>
<br>
</div><div>Allow the playlists to be editable and to include songs from the catalog even if they aren't currently on the iPod. That way I can build a playlist on the go and push the playlist to my computer.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5446962-8318457947703864552?l=coolaj86.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
