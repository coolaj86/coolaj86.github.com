As part of getting up and running on FsckVPS I decided to go with Nginx rather than Apache because it's so hot right now (like Hansel) and I figured it's something I should learn.
<br>

<br>
Well, after setting up Nginx with Passenger, Ruby / Rack / Rails, and Python / WSGI / TurboGears I have to say that there is no reason in my mind to go back to apache.
<br>

<br>
Nginx is simpler than Apache in the same way that JSON is simpler than XML.
<br>

This is much less complicated than it sounds:
<br>

<br>
<ol><li>Installed Ubuntu 9.04</li><li>Installed latest stable ruby (which includes rubygems) from source</li><li>Installed passenger gem</li><li>Installed nginx from source with passenger</li><li>Configured nginx (including init.d)</li><li>What!? Entirely amazed that I got it right on the first try!</li></ol><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3223021047265210707-7414293227431011042?l=thesystemisntdown.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
