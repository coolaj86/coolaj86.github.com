I've already done this once before, but I didn't blog it, so I forgot it. (You have to teach something in order to really learn it).
<br>

<br>

<br>
Essentially: The "belongs_to :arbitrary_name" means what you're going to call all of the different things to which this item can belong. It's arbitrary. The "has_many" of the owner has to include "as :arbitrary_name" 
<br>

<br>

<br>
Let's say you're doing asynchronous uploads using <a href="http://www.coolaj86.info/cors_uploads/">cors_uploads</a> and <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/04/multiple-attachments-with-vali.html">PaperClip</a>  and you don't know what something is going to be attached at the time  you upload it.
<br>

<br>
Scenario:
<br>
Professors can create assignments and attach several files are necessary for students to have in order to complete the assignment.
<br>

<br>
Likewise, Students can upload multiple files with an assignment. 
<br>

<br>
When they add a file it begins to upload immediately.
<br>
When the file completes a callback adds its ID to a hidden field in the form.
<br>
If the form is submitted before the uploads are complete the callback updates the upload with the assignment ID instead of adding its ID to the form.
<br>
If the browser window is about to be closed it will warn the user if uploads are still in progress.
<br>

<br>
One solution is to have a model for student uploads and another for professor uploads... but that leads to a possibly messy file system as you add more and more types of uploads.
<br>

<br>
Instead we create one model for assets which can belong_to anything "attachable". We define that assignments and submissions can have many assets as an attachable.
<br>

<br>

<pre><code>
class Asset &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br>
    belongs_to :attachable, :polymorphic =&gt; true
<br>
  end
<br>

<br>
  class Assignment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br>
    has_many :assets, :as =&gt; :attachable         # The :as option specifies the polymorphic interface to use.
<br>
  end&nbsp;</code></pre>
<pre><code>
&nbsp;</code></pre>
<pre><code>
class Submission &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br>
    has_many :assets, :as =&gt; :attachable         # The :as option specifies the polymorphic interface to use.
<br>
  end
<br>
&nbsp;</code></pre>
<pre><code>
&nbsp;</code></pre>
<pre><code>
# Then something like </code></pre>
<pre><code>
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
if params[assignment]</code></pre>
<pre><code>
@asset.attachable = Assignment.find(params[assignment][:id])</code></pre>
<pre><code>
elsif params[submission]</code></pre>
<pre><code>
@asset.attachable = Submission.find(params[submission][:id]) </code></pre>
<pre><code>
end&nbsp;</code></pre>
<pre><code>
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
# Or</code></pre>
<pre><code>
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
@assignment.assets &lt;&lt; Asset.find(params[asset][:id])  </code></pre>
