ActiveScaffold website hasn't been updated with a little detail that's fairly important.
<br>

<br>

<pre><code>
map.resources :abcxyz_types, :active_scaffold => true
<br>
  map.resources :abcxyzs, :active_scaffold => true
<br>
</code></pre>
<br>
You need to tell config.routes.rb that you're using active scaffold.
<br>

<pre><code>
ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound in AssignmentsController#show

As it turns out, the official website isn't as official as the wiki. Go figure.
